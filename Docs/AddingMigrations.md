## dotnet ef migrations add InitialCreate

A command used in Entity Framework Core to create the initial database migration, similar to Penguin Architects planning a new colony.

- **Create Initial Migration**: Generates migration files based on current entity models, like drawing blueprints for igloos and fishing spots
- **Version Control**: Establishes a starting point for tracking schema changes, akin to documenting the initial colony layout
- **Not Applied Yet**: Creates migration files without applying changes, just as plans are drawn but no actual construction has begun

This command is typically run when setting up a new database using EF Core's Code-First approach, allowing developers to manage and version control their database schema, much like Penguin Architects planning future expansions.

```bash
dotnet ef migrations add InitialCreate
```

## dotnet ef database update

A command used in Entity Framework Core to apply pending migrations to the database, similar to Snowball Engineers actually building the penguin colony.

- **Apply Migrations**: Executes all pending migrations on the target database, like constructing igloos and shaping the landscape
- **Update Schema**: Brings the database schema in sync with the current EF Core model, ensuring the colony matches the latest approved plans
- **Create Database**: If the database doesn't exist, it creates one before applying migrations, just as engineers might create a new ice platform if needed

This command is typically ran after adding new migrations to update the database schema, ensuring it matches the current state of your application's data model, much like Snowball Engineers implementing the latest colony design.

```bash
dotnet ef database update

```
