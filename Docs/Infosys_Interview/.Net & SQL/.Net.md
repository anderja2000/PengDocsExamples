# .NET and C# Knowledge Base

---

### Must Have

---

#### Utilize the dotnet command line tools to generate and execute projects.

Use the .NET CLI to create and run projects, such as `dotnet new console -n MyApp` followed by `dotnet run` (W). This allows developers to quickly scaffold and test applications (H). It is essential for .NET development, providing an efficient workflow for building and running apps (Y).

---

#### Create methods that use appropriate control flow to process an operation.

Methods can use control flow constructs (loops, conditionals) to process operations based on input (W). For example, methods like `public int Sum(int a, int b) { return a + b; }` use conditionals to implement logic (H). Control flow is fundamental in structuring functional application behavior (Y).

---

#### Describe the purpose and structure of a unit test.

Unit tests verify individual units of functionality to ensure correctness (W). A unit test generally includes setup, test, and teardown steps, typically following the pattern: `Arrange`, `Act`, `Assert` (H). They help ensure software reliability and catch bugs early in development (Y).

---

#### Create a functional application to fulfill behavioral requirements and user stories.

A functional application is designed to meet specific requirements and user stories (W). This includes writing code that implements the application's logic, like a simple console app: `public class MyApp { public static void Main() { Console.WriteLine("Hello, World!"); } }` (H). The goal is to create working, user-driven software (Y).

---

### Should Have

---

#### Use encapsulation and abstraction in applications, with appropriate access modifiers and modifiers on classes and methods.

Encapsulation hides internal data and only exposes necessary methods, while abstraction reduces complexity by only exposing essential functionality (W). Access modifiers like `public`, `private`, and `protected` define visibility (H). This is a key design principle for building maintainable applications (Y).

---

#### Use inheritance and polymorphism to create classes that have inherited members, and overrides or overloads members as necessary.

Inheritance allows classes to reuse members from other classes, and polymorphism enables objects of different types to be treated as instances of the same base class (W). Methods can be overridden or overloaded for customized behavior (H). This helps to create flexible and reusable code (Y).

---

#### Use a testing framework to create meaningful unit tests for an application.

Frameworks like NUnit or xUnit help write structured unit tests (W). Unit tests ensure functionality works as expected, like `public class MyAppTests { [Fact] public void TestSum() { Assert.Equal(3, new MyApp().Sum(1, 2)); } }` (H). Testing frameworks improve test automation and code quality (Y).

---

#### Implement nullable types in an application.

Nullable types are used for variables that can hold a null value, like `int? nullableInt = null;` (W). Using nullable types helps handle missing or undefined data (H). This is important for working with databases or user inputs where null values are common (Y).

---

#### Utilize the collections namespace, and types that extend the IEnumerable interface in an application.

Types like `List<T>` and `Dictionary<TKey, TValue>` implement `IEnumerable`, making them easy to iterate (W). These collections are key for storing and manipulating data in a variety of ways (H). They provide efficient, flexible ways to manage collections of objects (Y).

---

### Nice to Have

---

#### Use logging frameworks to record vital events within a running application.

Frameworks like NLog or Serilog allow logging important events (W). Implementing logging can help with debugging, monitoring, and tracing application execution (H). Logging vital runtime information is critical in production environments (Y).

---

#### Use theory testing and multiple assertion types to verify a method's function with unit testing.

Theory testing allows you to run the same test with multiple inputs (W). Assertions like `Assert.Equal`, `Assert.True`, and `Assert.NotNull` verify that methods function correctly (H). This strengthens the robustness of unit tests and ensures correctness across various cases (Y).

---

### Advanced Concepts

---

#### Implement lambda expressions in an application.

Lambda expressions provide a concise way to define anonymous methods or delegates (W). For example, `Func<int, int, int> sum = (a, b) => a + b;` allows quick function definition (H). This is important for simplifying code and enabling functional programming patterns (Y).

---

#### Implement recursion in an application.

Recursion involves a method calling itself to solve problems that can be broken down into smaller sub-problems (W). For example, calculating factorial with `public int Factorial(int n) { if (n <= 1) return 1; else return n * Factorial(n - 1); }` (H). Recursion simplifies solutions for problems with repetitive, hierarchical structures (Y).

---

### C# Questions

---



### C# Intermediate

#### What is a class in C#?

A class in C# is a blueprint for creating objects that encapsulate data and behavior (W). It defines properties, methods, and events that are associated with the objects created from it (H). Classes are fundamental to object-oriented programming, allowing for code organization and reuse (Y).

#### What are the differences between Value types and Reference types?

Value types store data directly, while reference types store a reference to the data's memory location (W). For example, `int` is a value type, whereas `string` is a reference type (H). This distinction affects memory allocation and performance, as value types are typically allocated on the stack and reference types on the heap (Y).

#### What are some collections available in C#? (Beyond List)

C# provides several collections beyond `List`, including `Dictionary<TKey, TValue>`, `HashSet<T>`, `Queue<T>`, and `Stack<T>` (W). Each collection serves different purposes, such as storing key-value pairs or managing items in a first-in-first-out (FIFO) or last-in-first-out (LIFO) manner (H). These collections enhance data management capabilities in applications (Y).

#### How do we achieve Abstraction in C#?

Abstraction is achieved in C# through abstract classes and interfaces that define methods without implementing them (W). For example, an abstract class can declare methods that derived classes must implement (H). This allows developers to focus on high-level functionality while hiding complex implementation details (Y).

#### How do we achieve Encapsulation?

Encapsulation is achieved by restricting access to an object's internal state and exposing only necessary parts through public methods or properties (W). This is typically done using access modifiers like `private` and `public` (H). Encapsulation helps protect the integrity of the object's data and reduces dependencies between components (Y).

#### How about Inheritance?

Inheritance allows one class to inherit members (properties and methods) from another class (W). In C#, this is done using the colon syntax, e.g., `class Derived : Base` (H). Inheritance promotes code reuse and establishes a hierarchical relationship between classes, making it easier to manage related functionality (Y).

#### Polymorphism in C#?

Polymorphism allows methods to do different things based on the object that it is acting upon, typically through method overriding or interface implementation (W). For example, a base class method can be overridden in derived classes to provide specific behavior (H). This enables flexibility in code design and enhances extensibility (Y).

#### What is overloading?

Overloading refers to defining multiple methods with the same name but different parameters within the same class or scope (W). For example, you can have `void Print(int number)` and `void Print(string text)` as overloaded methods (H). This allows for method flexibility based on input types or numbers of parameters while maintaining readability (Y).

#### What is overriding?

Overriding occurs when a derived class provides a specific implementation of a method that is already defined in its base class (W). This is done using the `override` keyword in C# (H). Overriding enables polymorphic behavior where the derived class's method is called instead of the base class's method when invoked on an object of the derived class (Y).

#### What's the difference between overloading and overriding?

Overloading involves creating multiple methods with the same name but different signatures within the same class, while overriding involves redefining a base class method in a derived class with the same signature (W). Overloading occurs at compile-time, while overriding occurs at runtime through polymorphism (H). Both enhance code flexibility but serve different purposes in design patterns (Y).

#### What are properties?

Properties are special methods called accessors that provide a flexible mechanism to read, write, or compute values of private fields in a class (W). They use get and set accessors to encapsulate field access while allowing controlled interaction with an object's data (H). Properties enhance encapsulation by providing controlled access to an object's internal state without exposing its implementation details directly (Y).

#### What are fields?

Fields are variables declared within a class that hold data associated with an object instance or static data for the class itself (W). They can be public or private depending on how they should be accessed from outside the class (H). Fields represent an object's state and are essential for storing information relevant to its behavior and characteristics (Y).

#### What are methods?

Methods are functions defined within a class that describe behaviors or actions that an object can perform (W). They can take parameters, return values, and contain logic to manipulate data or perform operations related to the object's state (H). Methods encapsulate functionality within classes, promoting code organization and reuse across applications (Y).

#### What is a constructor?

A constructor is a special method invoked when an instance of a class is created, initializing the object's state by setting initial values for its fields or executing startup logic (W). Constructors have the same name as the class and do not have a return type (H). They ensure that objects start their life cycle in a valid state before being used in an application context (Y).

#### Describe 4 commonly used access modifiers in C#

- **Public**: Members are accessible from any other code.

- **Private**: Members are accessible only within their own class.

- **Protected**: Members are accessible within their own class and by derived classes.

- **Internal**: Members are accessible only within their own assembly but not from another assembly (W). These modifiers control visibility and accessibility of members based on design requirements and encapsulation principles (H). Proper use of access modifiers enhances security and maintainability of code by limiting exposure of internal workings of classes to external entities(Y).

#### What does static modifier do?

The static modifier indicates that a member belongs to the type itself rather than to any specific instance of that type (W). Static members can be accessed without creating an instance of the class using `ClassName.MemberName` syntax(H). This is useful for shared data or utility functions that do not require object instantiation(Y).

#### Is it perfectly fine to always use implicit typing instead of strongly typing my variables? 

False. While implicit typing (`var`) can simplify code by reducing verbosity, it may lead to reduced readability and maintainability if overused. Strongly typing variables provides clearer intent about what type of data is expected(H), which helps prevent runtime errors due to type mismatches(Y).

#### What is regular expressions? Give me some use cases for regex's.

Regular expressions are patterns used to match character combinations in strings(H) . They can be used for validating formats like email addresses or phone numbers , searching for specific patterns , or replacing substrings within text(W) . Regular expressions enhance string manipulation capabilities significantly(Y).

#### Bonus: What could be a regex for validating email address?

A basic regex pattern for validating email addresses could be: 

```

^[a-zA-Z0-9._%+-]+@[a-zA-Z0-9.-]+\.[a-zA-Z]{2,}$

```

This pattern checks for common email formats(W) . It ensures there's text before an '@' symbol followed by domain characters , enhancing validation accuracy(H) . Regex patterns help ensure input meets expected formats , reducing errors during processing(Y).

#### What is unmanaged resource and how do you manage it?

Unmanaged resources refer to resources not handled by .NET's garbage collector , such as file handles , database connections , or network sockets(W) . They must be explicitly released using techniques like implementing IDisposable interface , which includes Dispose method(H) . Proper management prevents resource leaks , ensuring efficient application performance(Y).

#### What is serialization?

Serialization is the process of converting an object into a format suitable for storage or transmission , such as binary or XML(W) . It allows objects to be persisted or sent over networks(H) . Serialization facilitates data exchange between applications or saving application state across sessions(Y).

#### What are generic classes?

Generic classes allow you to define classes with type parameters , enabling them to operate with any data type while maintaining type safety(W) . For example: 

```csharp

public class GenericList<T> { /*...*/ }

```

This allows creating lists for various types without duplicating code(H) . Generics enhance code reusability , reduce redundancy , and improve performance by avoiding boxing/unboxing when working with value types(Y).

#### What is boxing and unboxing?

Boxing is converting a value type into an object type by wrapping it inside an object instance(W) . Unboxing extracts the value type from its boxed representation(H) . This process allows value types to be treated as objects but comes with performance overhead due to additional memory allocation(Y).

#### What's a struct, and how is it different from a class?

A struct is a value type that can encapsulate data and related functionality like classes(W) . However, structs are typically used for small data structures because they have value semantics; when assigned or passed around, they copy their values rather than references(H) . The key difference lies in memory allocation; structs are allocated on the stack while classes reside on the heap(Y).

#### What is lambda expression?

A lambda expression provides a concise way to represent anonymous functions using syntax `(parameters) => expression`(W) . For example: 

```csharp

Func<int, int> square = x => x * x;

```

Lambda expressions enable functional programming styles by allowing inline function definitions(H) . They simplify event handling , LINQ queries , and other scenarios requiring short-lived functions(Y).

### Testing

#### What do you use to unit test in C#?

In C#, popular testing frameworks include NUnit , xUnit , and MSTest which provide tools for writing structured unit tests(W) . These frameworks offer assertions , test runners , and test organization features(H) . They help ensure code correctness through automated testing practices(Y).

#### Describe AAA of unit testing

The AAA pattern stands for Arrange , Act , Assert(W) . It structures unit tests into three clear steps: setting up necessary conditions(Arrange), executing functionality(Act), then verifying outcomes(Assert)(H) . This approach enhances readability , maintainability , and clarity of intent within unit tests(Y).

#### What do you unit test?

You unit test individual units of functionality such as methods or classes(W) . The goal is to verify correctness under various conditions including edge cases(H) . Unit testing ensures reliability during development cycles by catching bugs early before integration(Y).

#### What do you NOT unit test?

You do not unit test external dependencies like databases , file systems , or network calls since these involve integration testing rather than isolated unit tests(W) . Additionally, UI elements should not be unit tested but rather tested through integration tests(H) . Excluding these ensures unit tests remain focused on specific functionality without external interference(Y).

### Design Principles

#### Describe SOLID

SOLID refers to five design principles aimed at making software designs more understandable , flexible , and maintainable(W):

- **S**: Single Responsibility Principle

- **O**: Open/Closed Principle

- **L**: Liskov Substitution Principle

- **I**: Interface Segregation Principle

- **D**: Dependency Inversion Principle

These principles guide developers towards better software architecture practices(H), leading to robust applications capable of adapting over time(Y).

#### What is Singleton pattern, and when do we use it?

The Singleton pattern ensures only one instance of a class exists throughout an application's lifecycle(W) . It restricts instantiation via private constructors while providing global access through static methods(H) . This pattern is useful when exactly one object needs coordinated access across various parts of an application(Y).

#### What is factory method pattern, and when do we use it?

The Factory Method pattern defines an interface for creating objects but lets subclasses alter the type of objects created(W) . It promotes loose coupling by allowing instantiation logic outside client code(H) . Use this pattern when your application needs flexibility regarding which subclasses should be instantiated based on varying conditions(Y).

#### What is dependency injection, and why do we use it?

Dependency Injection(DI) involves providing dependencies from outside rather than hardcoding them inside classes(W) . This promotes loose coupling between components allowing easier testing , maintenance , and scalability(H) . DI enhances modularity by enabling easier swapping out implementations without altering dependent components(Y).

#### How does dependency injection differ from dependency inversion?

Dependency Injection refers specifically to techniques used for injecting dependencies into classes(W), whereas Dependency Inversion Principle states high-level modules should not depend on low-level modules but both should depend on abstractions(H). DI implements this principle by providing abstractions at runtime rather than compile-time dependencies(Y).

#### What is separation of concerns principle?

Separation of Concerns(SOC) principle advocates dividing software into distinct sections each addressing separate concerns(W). This leads towards modularization where each module handles specific functionalities independently(H). SOC improves maintainability since changes made within one concern don't affect others directly facilitating easier updates over time(Y).

---

#### What is C#?

C# is a modern, object-oriented programming language developed by Microsoft as part of the .NET platform (W). It is used for building a variety of applications, including web, desktop, and mobile (H). C# is known for its rich feature set and ease of use in developing enterprise software (Y).

---

#### What is .NET Platform?

The .NET platform is a software framework used to develop and run applications on Windows, macOS, and Linux (W). It provides a large class library and supports various programming languages, including C# (H). .NET simplifies application development and deployment, ensuring cross-platform compatibility (Y).

---

#### What is Intermediary Language (IL)?

IL is a low-level programming language used by the .NET runtime (W). C# code is compiled into IL, which is then executed by the Common Language Runtime (CLR) (H). IL allows code to be platform-agnostic and enables the .NET runtime to execute code across different environments (Y).

---

#### What does .csproj file do?

The `.csproj` file is a project file that contains metadata, references, and configurations for building a C# project (W). It defines properties like target framework, output type, and referenced assemblies (H). The `.csproj` file is crucial for managing project dependencies and build processes (Y).

---

#### When do we use project reference?

Project references are used to include another project in your solution, making its classes and methods available for use (W). This is typically done for code reuse and modularization (H). By referencing another project, you can share code across multiple applications or libraries (Y).

---

#### What is a solution in .NET?

A solution is a container for one or more related projects (W). It allows developers to organize code into projects, manage dependencies, and configure build settings (H). Solutions provide a structured way to handle complex applications with multiple projects (Y).

---

#### C# Basics

---

#### Which method do I use to write something to the console?

Use `Console.WriteLine()` to output text to the console (W). For example, `Console.WriteLine("Hello, World!");` (H). This method is the primary way to display information in a console application (Y).

---

#### How about taking user input from the console?

Use `Console.ReadLine()` to read user input from the console (W). This returns a string, which can be parsed as needed (H). It is commonly used for interactive console applications (Y).

---

#### How do I take a string input and convert to integer and vice versa?

Use `int.Parse()` or `Convert.ToInt32()` to convert a string to an integer (W). For converting an integer to a string, use `ToString()` (H). Example: `int number = int.Parse(Console.ReadLine());` (Y).

---

#### Why do we create methods? What are the benefits of compartmentalizing your code?

Methods help organize code into reusable blocks that perform specific tasks (W). Benefits include improved readability, reusability, and easier debugging (H). Methods allow for cleaner, more maintainable code (Y).

---

#### What is an array? How do you initialize one?

An array is a collection of elements of the same type (W). It can be initialized like `int[] numbers = new int[5];` (H). Arrays are useful for storing multiple values of the same type and accessing them by index (Y).

---

#### What is variable declaration?

Variable declaration defines a variable's type and name (W). For example, `int age;` declares a variable `age` of type `int` (H). It does not assign a value but prepares the variable for future use (Y).

---

#### What is variable initialization?

Variable initialization assigns an initial value to a declared variable (W). For example, `int age = 30;` initializes the variable `age` with the value 30 (H). Initialization is essential for using variables in computations or logic (Y).

---

#### What is the main method? Why is it important?

The main method is the entry point for a C# application (W). It is where the application starts execution (H). Without the main method, the application cannot run (Y).

---

#### Why do we not see the main method after .NET 6?

.NET 6 and later versions support "top-level statements," which simplify the entry point by removing the explicit `Main` method (W). This reduces boilerplate code for simple applications (H). It is a design choice for cleaner, more concise code (Y).

---

#### Debugger: What are breakpoints? What happens when the program hits the breakpoint?

Breakpoints are markers in the code that tell the debugger to pause execution at that point (W). When a breakpoint is hit, developers can inspect variables and step through the code to troubleshoot (H). This is essential for debugging and identifying issues (Y).

---

#### Debugger: What is step over, step into, step out?

`Step over` executes the current line without diving into any method calls (W). `Step into` allows entering a method to see its internal code (H). `Step out` finishes the current method and returns to the caller (Y). These functions are critical for debugging (Y).

---

#### What are exceptions? Why do we use them?

Exceptions are errors that occur during program execution (W). They are used to signal abnormal conditions and handle errors gracefully (H). Exceptions allow programs to recover from unexpected situations and continue running (Y).

---

#### Describe Try/Catch/Finally

`Try` is used to wrap code that may throw an exception (W). `Catch` handles the exception (H). `Finally` executes code that runs regardless of whether an exception was thrown (Y). This is essential for error handling (Y).
