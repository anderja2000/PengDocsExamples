# Preparation Plan

## 1. Soft Skills Improvement

### Eye Contact and Camera Presence
- **Practice in Front of a Mirror or Camera**: Spend 10-15 minutes daily practicing your responses while maintaining eye contact with the camera. This will help you become more comfortable in front of the camera.
- **Use a Sticky Note**: Place a sticky note near your camera as a reminder to look into the lens instead of at the screen.

### Conciseness and Clarity
- **Practice Answering Questions**: Limit your answers to 1-2 minutes. Use the STAR (Situation, Task, Action, Result) method for behavioral questions to keep your responses focused.
- **Record Yourself**: Record practice sessions and review them to identify areas where you tend to ramble or lose focus.

## 2. Technical Knowledge Enhancement

### Understanding Key Concepts
- **Review Key Concepts**: Spend time reviewing core concepts in .NET, C#, and React. Focus on:
  - **OOP Principles**: Understand how abstraction, encapsulation, inheritance, and polymorphism work together.
  - **Expressions**: Define expressions clearly as syntactic constructs that evaluate to a single value.
  - **Constructors**: Explain constructors as special methods used to initialize objects of a class.
  - **ORMs and DbContext**: Know that ORM is a programming technique that allows interaction with databases using high-level programming languages, while DbContext represents a session with the database.
  - **Asynchronous Programming**: Understand that it allows for non-blocking operations using async/await keywords, particularly useful for I/O-bound operations.

### Practice Explaining Concepts
- **Explain Concepts Without Examples**: Practice explaining technical concepts without relying on specific examples. Focus on definitions and their importance in programming.

## 3. Mock Interview Practice

### Engage in Mock Interviews
- **Schedule Mock Interviews**: Arrange at least two mock interviews before Friday with friends or mentors who can provide constructive feedback.
- **Focus on Behavioral Questions**: Prepare concise answers for behavioral questions like conflict resolution, teamwork preferences, and customer service experiences.

## 4. Refining Your Responses

Here are refined answers based on the feedback you received:

- **Tell me about yourself.**
  > "I am currently an associate at Revature, where I am part of an intense bootcamp focusing on .NET development with C# and React. I graduated from Indiana University with a Bachelor's in Informatics. My experience includes collaborating in teams to develop web applications and troubleshoot technical issues effectively. I enjoy learning new languages and technologies, which helps me adapt quickly in dynamic environments."

- **Where do you see yourself in five years?**
  > "In five years, I envision myself as a senior developer with expertise in full-stack development. I aim to deepen my understanding of software architecture and explore emerging technologies like cloud computing and machine learning, contributing to innovative projects that enhance user experiences."

- **Tell me about a time you were in conflict with a co-worker and how you resolved that conflict.**
  > "In my role at the helpdesk, I encountered a situation where my colleague and I had different approaches to addressing client issues. We initially misunderstood each otherâ€™s perspectives regarding a technical problem faced by a client. To resolve this, I initiated a discussion where we shared our viewpoints openly, which led us to collaborate effectively on troubleshooting the issue together."

- **Do you prefer working alone or as part of a team? Why?**
  > "I prefer working as part of a team because collaboration fosters creativity and innovation. Working with others allows us to share diverse perspectives, which often leads to better problem-solving outcomes."

- **A co-worker is taking office supplies without permission; what do you do?**
  > "I would approach my co-worker privately to discuss my observations before escalating the issue. Open communication can often resolve misunderstandings without creating unnecessary tension."

- **Give an example of a time when you went the extra mile for a customer or client.**
  > "While working at the helpdesk, I assisted an older client who struggled with OneDrive usage. Instead of just resolving the technical issue, I took extra time to explain how OneDrive works and helped him understand file management better, ensuring he felt confident using the tool moving forward."

## 5. Technical Questions Review

Prepare concise answers for these commonly asked technical questions:

- **What are the four pillars of OOP?**
  > "The four pillars are Abstraction (hiding complexity), Encapsulation (restricting access), Inheritance (deriving new classes), and Polymorphism (using objects of different classes interchangeably)."

- **What is an expression?**
  > "An expression is a syntactic construct that evaluates to a single value in C#. For example, assigning `int x = 5;` is an expression where `5` is evaluated as an integer."

- **What are constructors?**
  > "Constructors are special methods used for initializing new objects of a class when they are created."

- **What is an ORM?**
  > "An ORM (Object-Relational Mapping) is a programming technique that allows developers to interact with databases using high-level programming languages instead of SQL directly."

- **What is the DbContext Class?**
  > "DbContext represents a session with the database allowing querying and saving instances of entities within it."

- **What is Asynchronous programming?**
  > "Asynchronous programming allows methods to run independently without blocking the main thread, particularly useful for I/O-bound operations using async/await keywords."
