# HTML + CSS Knowledge Base

---

### Must Have

####  What is HTML? What do we use HTML for?

HTML (HyperText Markup Language) is the standard language for creating and structuring web pages (W). It defines the structure of a webpage by using elements like headings, paragraphs, and links (H). HTML is used to build the backbone of all web pages, providing the framework for content to be displayed and styled (Y).

---

####  What are HTML tags? Can you give me examples of common tags?

HTML tags are special keywords surrounded by angle brackets (`< >`) that define the elements on a webpage (W). Common examples include `<h1>` for headings, `<p>` for paragraphs, and `<a>` for links (H). Tags structure the content and provide instructions to the browser on how to display it (Y).

---

####  How are tags different from elements?

Tags are the building blocks used to create HTML elements (W). An element includes both the opening and closing tags, as well as the content between them (H). For example, `<h1>Heading</h1>` is an element, while `<h1>` is just the tag (Y).

---

####  What are attributes?

Attributes provide additional information about an HTML element (W). They are specified inside the opening tag and define properties of the element, such as its class, ID, or link destination (H). For example, in `<a href="https://example.com">Link</a>`, the `href` is an attribute defining the link's destination (Y).

---

####  What are global attributes?

Global attributes are attributes that can be used with almost all HTML elements (W). Examples include `id`, `class`, and `style` (H). These attributes provide flexibility and allow for universal styling and identification across different elements (Y).

---

####  What’s the difference between `id` and `class` attributes?

The `id` attribute is unique to each element and should only be used once per page (W). The `class` attribute can be applied to multiple elements, allowing them to share the same styles (H). This distinction allows for more targeted styling with `id` and broader styling with `class` (Y).

---

####  What’s the difference between `head`, `header`, and `heading`?

- `<head>` contains metadata like the title and links to external resources (W).
- `<header>` is used for introductory content or navigation (H).
- `<h1>`, `<h2>`, etc., are heading tags used to define the structure of content (Y).

---

####  What are semantic tags? Why would we want to use them?

Semantic tags, like `<article>`, `<section>`, and `<footer>`, convey meaning about the content they wrap (W). Using semantic tags improves accessibility and SEO by making content more understandable to browsers and search engines (H). They help organize content logically, improving both readability and functionality (Y).

---

####  How do we use forms to accept user input?

Forms in HTML are used to collect user input (W). They are created using the `<form>` element and can contain various input fields like text boxes, radio buttons, and checkboxes (H). The form's `action` attribute specifies where the data should be sent for processing (Y).

---

####  What are inline & block elements?

Inline elements, like `<span>`, take up only as much width as their content and don’t break the flow of the document (W). Block elements, like `<div>` and `<p>`, take up the full width of their container and begin on a new line (H). Understanding this difference helps with layout control and formatting (Y).

---

####  What are the two main parts of an HTML document? What are their roles?

An HTML document has two main sections: the `<head>` and the `<body>` (W). The `<head>` contains metadata, links to external files, and other resources, while the `<body>` holds the visible content of the page (H). These sections help structure and manage the page’s content and resources (Y).

---

####  How are images created in HTML?

Images are included in HTML using the `<img>` tag (W). The `src` attribute defines the image's source, and the `alt` attribute provides alternative text for accessibility (H). For example: `<img src="image.jpg" alt="Description">` (Y).

---

####  How are links created in HTML?

Links are created using the `<a>` tag (W). The `href` attribute defines the destination URL, and the content inside the tag is the clickable text (H). For example: `<a href="https://example.com">Click Here</a>` (Y).

---

####  How are lists created in HTML?

Lists can be created using the `<ul>` tag for unordered lists or the `<ol>` tag for ordered lists (W). Each item in the list is wrapped in an `<li>` element (H). For example, `<ul><li>Item 1</li><li>Item 2</li></ul>` (Y).

---

####  How are forms created in HTML?

Forms are created using the `<form>` element, with different types of inputs like `<input>`, `<select>`, and `<textarea>` for various user interactions (W). The form also includes a `submit` button to send the data (H). Example: `<form><input type="text" name="name"><button type="submit">Submit</button></form>` (Y).

---

####  What features were introduced in HTML5?

HTML5 introduced several new features, such as new form controls, `<canvas>` for drawing, `<video>` and `<audio>` for media playback, and local storage (W). These features enhance user interaction, multimedia integration, and offline capabilities (H). HTML5 improves the overall functionality and performance of web pages (Y).

### Must Have - CSS

---

####  What is CSS? What’s the purpose of CSS in a webpage?

CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) is used to style the visual presentation of HTML elements on a webpage (W). It allows developers to control colors, fonts, layouts, and positioning of elements (H). CSS enhances user experience by improving the look and feel of web pages (Y).

---

####  What are selectors?

Selectors in CSS are patterns used to select HTML elements for styling (W). They can target elements by their type, class, id, attributes, etc. (H). For example, `p` selects all paragraph elements, while `.class-name` selects elements with a specific class (Y).

---

####  What are rules?

A CSS rule consists of a selector and a declaration block (W). The selector specifies which HTML elements the rule applies to, and the declaration block contains the styles to be applied (H). For example: `p { color: red; font-size: 16px; }` (Y).

---

####  What is the CSS box model?

The CSS box model defines how elements are structured and sized in a webpage (W). It includes content, padding, border, and margin, which affect the total width and height of an element (H). Understanding the box model is crucial for layout and spacing (Y).

---

####  What is responsive web design?

Responsive web design ensures that a webpage looks good on all devices, regardless of screen size (W). It uses techniques like media queries and flexible grids to adapt the layout to different screen sizes (H). This is essential for building mobile-friendly websites (Y).

---

####  What are the 3 ways to introduce CSS styling to a site?

CSS can be added in three ways: inline (using the `style` attribute), internal (within the `<style>` tag in the `<head>`), and external (linking to a separate `.css` file) (W). External CSS is generally preferred for maintainability and separation of concerns (H) (Y).

---

####  What is CSS specificity?

CSS specificity determines which rule is applied when multiple conflicting rules target the same element (W). The specificity hierarchy is: inline styles > IDs > classes > elements (H). This helps resolve conflicts and ensures the correct styles are applied (Y).

---

####  What is cascading in CSS?

Cascading in CSS refers to the priority order in which styles are applied (W). Styles are applied based on their specificity and order of appearance in the code (H). This allows for flexible and manageable styling (Y).

---

####  What does responsive web design mean?

Responsive web design ensures that a webpage adapts its layout and elements to different screen sizes and devices (W). It uses techniques like flexible grids and media queries (H). Responsive design improves user experience across devices like smartphones, tablets, and desktops (Y).
