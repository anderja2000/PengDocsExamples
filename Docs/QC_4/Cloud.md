#### What is Cloud Computing?

Cloud computing is the on-demand delivery of computing services over the internet, including servers, storage, databases, networking, software, and analytics (W). It enables users to store and access data remotely rather than on local devices (H). This flexibility allows for cost savings and increased efficiency in managing IT resources (Y) [1][2][3].

#### What are the benefits of cloud computing?

The benefits of cloud computing include cost optimization, speed, global scale, performance, security, and flexibility (W). Organizations can reduce capital expenditures by avoiding the costs associated with maintaining physical data centers (H). This leads to improved operational efficiency and the ability to scale resources quickly according to demand (Y) [4][5].

#### Tell me about different types of scaling (vertical vs horizontal).

**Vertical scaling** (scaling up) involves adding more power (CPU, RAM) to an existing machine (W). This method can lead to increased performance but has limitations in terms of maximum capacity (H). **Horizontal scaling** (scaling out), on the other hand, involves adding more machines or instances to handle increased load (W). This approach enhances fault tolerance and can be more cost-effective in the long run (Y) [5].

#### What's the difference between public and private cloud?

A **public cloud** provides services over the internet to multiple users and organizations, allowing for shared resources and economies of scale (W). In contrast, a **private cloud** is a dedicated environment for a single organization, offering enhanced security and control over data and applications (H). The choice between them often depends on specific business needs regarding compliance and security (Y) [3][4].

#### What is PaaS? When would you use that? What's an example of PaaS?

**Platform as a Service (PaaS)** is a cloud computing service that provides a platform allowing developers to build, deploy, and manage applications without worrying about the underlying infrastructure (W). PaaS is ideal when rapid application development is needed without the overhead of managing hardware or operating systems (H). An example of PaaS is Heroku, which allows developers to deploy web applications easily (Y) [2][4].

#### What is IaaS? When would you use that? What's an example of IaaS?

**Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS)** offers virtualized computing resources over the internet, enabling users to rent servers and storage on a pay-as-you-go basis (W). IaaS is useful when businesses need flexible infrastructure that can scale according to their workload demands without investing in physical hardware (H). An example of IaaS is Amazon Web Services (AWS), which provides scalable server instances and storage options (Y) [3][5].

#### What is SaaS? When would you use that? What's an example of SaaS?

**Software as a Service (SaaS)** delivers software applications over the internet on a subscription basis, allowing users to access them via a web browser without installation or maintenance requirements (W). SaaS is beneficial for organizations looking for easy-to-deploy solutions that minimize IT overhead (H). An example of SaaS is Google Workspace, which provides productivity tools like Docs and Sheets online (Y) [2][4].

#### What is SLA?

A **Service Level Agreement (SLA)** is a contract between a service provider and a customer that outlines expected service levels regarding availability, performance, and responsibilities. SLAs are used to ensure accountability and set clear expectations for service delivery (W). They help organizations understand their rights and recourse if service levels are not met (H), thus fostering trust in cloud services (Y) [5].

#### What is a region in cloud? Why are they important?

A **region** in cloud computing refers to a specific geographical area where cloud service providers have data centers. Regions are important because they affect latency, compliance with local regulations, and disaster recovery strategies. Choosing the right region can optimize performance by minimizing delays in data transfer while also ensuring adherence to legal requirements concerning data sovereignty (W) [4][5].
